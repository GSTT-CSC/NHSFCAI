### Fellowship Bio
Dr Rory Maclean is a Clinical Pharmacology Registrar in London, and Clinical Academic at UCL. He is interest in the "translation" of clinical informatics to build software tools for the NHS.
### Fellowship Project
##### _AI in Lung Nodule Diagnosis: A Simulation-Based Clinical Pathway Analysis_
##### Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust
The goal of this project was to evaluate the current Chest X-ray AI applications on the market, and to understand the opportunity for an open-source NHS-academic developed application. My role was to lead on the analysis and presentation of a patient and public involvement study, to systemically evaluate the published literature for on-market AI systems, and to simulate the effects of AI systems on the clinical pathway. Having completed the public involvement study, we better understand that the public support the use of AI in radiology, and expect human-in-the loop applications. Analysis of the clinical pathway showed that successful systems must improve diagnostic performance, whilst managing the resource utilisation of the whole pathway.
### Fellowship Testimonial
The greatest benefit of the fellowship has been to meet and share ideas with clinical AI fellows. I developing my skills in the "full stack" of clinical AI, including evaluation, implementation science, and regulatory. In my future career, I hope to contribute to decision making on AI procurement.
